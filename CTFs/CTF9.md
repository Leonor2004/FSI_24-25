# CTF10

This document is a brief explanation of our resolution of the Classical Encryption CTF given to us during week 10.

## Recognition

First we start exploring the encrypted text to discover how the cipher used works and found that it uses a classical cipher. So we already know that the each symbol in the ecrypted text corresponds to a letter in the original text.

## Deciphering Methodology

To explore the cipher we start doing a frequency analysis.
